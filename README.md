# Your First Local RAGÂ System

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a groundbreaking innovation in the AI landscape. Each new model brings enhanced features that revolutionize tasks such as text summarization, question answering, and retrieval systems.

However, despite their remarkable capabilities, many LLMs come with certain limitationsâ€Š-â€Šparticularly concerning privacy and reliance on cloud-based services for deployment. Relying on cloud-based APIs for LLM interactions can pose significant risks to sensitive data and limit accessibility in offline scenarios.

This article explores how to harness the power of LLMs to build a more robust, privacy-focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that operates entirely offline. By creating a local solution, you can ensure that your documents and queries remain as private as possible while maintaining the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs.
